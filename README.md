## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m a data analyst leveraging the power of Microsoft Excel and VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) to automate repetitive data tasks and create dynamic, interactive reports. This repository is a collection of projects, templates, and reusable code modules that showcase practical solutions for macro writing, data manipulation, and dashboard creation in Excel.

Excel remains one of the most widely used tools in business analytics, and with VBA, it becomes a powerful platform for building custom automation workflows. My focus is on streamlining data processing, reducing manual effort, and delivering insightful reports through smart automation.

Macro Writing: This repository includes well-documented VBA macros designed to handle everyday data tasksâ€”such as importing and cleaning data, generating pivot tables, refreshing queries, and formatting reports with a single click. These macros are built with error handling and modularity in mind, making them easy to adapt and extend.

Data Manipulation: Projects demonstrate techniques for transforming raw datasets into analysis-ready formats. From sorting and filtering to lookups, aggregations, and conditional formatting, the examples here are geared toward improving data quality and analysis speed.

Dashboard Creation: You'll find interactive dashboards that combine charts, slicers, and VBA-driven user interfaces to make reports both informative and user-friendly. These dashboards are ideal for tracking KPIs, summarizing trends, and presenting insights in a clear, professional format.

This repository is designed for data analysts, Excel power users, and professionals looking to automate and enhance their reporting workflows. Each project includes detailed instructions, sample files, and annotated code to help you get started quickly.

Feel free to explore, adapt, or contributeâ€”automation begins with sharing knowledge!
